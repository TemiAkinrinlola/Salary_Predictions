# Salary_Predictions

Accoding to Wikipedia,a salary is a form of payment from an employer to an employee, which may be specified in an employment contract. It is contrasted with piece wages, where each job, hour, or other unit is paid separately, rather than on a periodic basis. From the point of view of running a business, salary can also be viewed as the cost of acquiring and retaining human resources for running operations, and is then termed personnel expense or salary expense.

The current salary of an employee is determined by so many factors.Salary is determined by leveling the pay rates and salary ranges established by an individual employerand often, salary is affected by the number of people available to perform the specific job in the employer's employment locale.Typically,salary is determined by comparing market pay rates for people performing similar work in similar industries in the same region.
